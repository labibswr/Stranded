# Stranded

The following program is a pygame project that is a game about a character lost in space. The objective of the game is for the user to complete a series of levels to get the
character to the portal until it reaches the end. Upon completing the fifth level, the game is completed. If the player fails to complete a level, they are redirected to
an additional "resurrection" game that is a cursor based maze game. If the user can complete the resurrection, they will be placed back at the level they were playing at.
Failure of the resurrection game will result in "game over" and the user will have to replay back at level 1.

# Steps to Run:
1. Download the full repository as a zip folder on your machine.
2. Open with any Python interpreter or IDE (Visual Studio, Pycharm, etc.)
3. After initializing the Python interpreter, install the Python package "pygame" to your interpreter/virtual environment
4. Run the file "main.py"
5. Enjoy!
